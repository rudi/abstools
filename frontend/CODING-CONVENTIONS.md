# Coding Conventions

Coding conventions are kept in humand- and machine-readable form in
the file `.editorconfig` in this directory.

We encourage developers to add editorconfig support to their favorite
editor / IDE and use the settings in that file.  See
https://editorconfig.org for more information.
